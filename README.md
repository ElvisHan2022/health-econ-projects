# Healthcare Economics & Policy Projects

This repository highlights a collection of projects I have completed at the intersection of **public health, economics, regulatory policy, and data analysis**. These projects demonstrate my experience drafting policy memos, conducting regulatory and economic analyses, applying quantitative methods, and evaluating health & drug data across U.S. and international sources.

## 🏛️ 1. FDA – Regulatory Economics Internship

**Description:**  
Interned with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (Office of the Commissioner) analyzing the impacts of expedited approval programs and regulatory decision-making. Supported the agency with tools for policy evaluation and economic quantification.

**Key Methods & Tools:**  
- R for data visualization and exploratory analysis  
- Python (web scraper) for gathering Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs)  
- Comparative timeline analysis (e.g., IND → NDA durations)  
- Regulatory and policy evaluation frameworks

**Highlights:**  
- Created visualizations showing how expedited pathways reduce regulatory review times  
- Automated extraction of RIAs, improving research and reporting efficiency  
- Identified historical trends in FDA approval pathways to inform projections

## 🏢 2. Cato Institute – Health Policy & Drug Data Analyst Intern

**Description:**  
Worked on a variety of health policy and data analysis tasks, including drafting weekly memos for HHS-related topics, performing literature reviews, conducting outreach for telehealth legislation, and analyzing active ingredient overlap between human and animal drugs in the U.S. and Australia.

**Key Methods & Tools:**  
- Policy memo drafting & literature reviews (topics: overcoding, HSA investments, market capitalization, impact of CARES Act reimbursements for hospitals)  
- Stakeholder/legislative research + cold‐calling state governments (Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina) regarding SANE telehealth laws  
- Data analysis in Excel using U.S. FDA drug datasets and Australian datasets (Therapeutic Goods Administration / Australian Government, including PBS data)  
- Comparative active ingredient matching across human and veterinary drugs

**Highlights:**  
- Wrote policy memos that influenced internal recommendations on health reimbursement and regulatory policy  
- Conducted data-driven analysis identifying overlap in active ingredient usage between human and animal pharmaceuticals in U.S. vs. Australia  
- Tracked telehealth legal developments by directly surveying and querying state officials

## 📊 3. Healthcare Data Analysis (RAND Oregon Study)

**Description:**  
Analyzed demographic and insurance data from RAND Oregon to explore how insurance copayments and coverage plans affect hospital visits. Built regression models to evaluate healthcare utilization and out-of-pocket expenditure patterns.

**Key Methods & Tools:**  
- Logistic & linear regression (R)  
- Variable construction: risk & coverage levels, copayments, demographic controls  
- Health economics framing: utilization, access, cost burden

**Highlights:**  
- Identified significant relationships between copayment levels and frequency of hospital visits  
- Controlled for educational, geographic, and coverage confounders  
- Produced a full GitHub‐hosted final project with reproducible code and visualizations

## 💵 4. PKH Cost-Benefit Analysis (Indonesia)

**Description:**  
Evaluated Indonesia’s Program Keluarga Harapan (conditional cash transfer) using cost‐benefit, ROI, and budget impact modeling over an extended rollout.

**Key Methods & Tools:**  
- Cost‐effectiveness analysis (CEA)  
- Budget impact modeling  
- Sensitivity analysis and scenario testing  
- Excel and other quantitative tools

**Highlights:**  
- Modeled phased implementation across millions of households

## 🌍 Australian Data Source Note

- The **Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)** — part of Australia’s Department of Health — manages the *Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG)*, containing data on therapeutic goods legally supplied in Australia (formulation, sponsor, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- The **Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)** is Australia’s national prescription medicines subsidy program. Researchers use PBS data for medication dispensing, cost, utilization, and comparative drug usage analyses. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
