# Healthcare Economics and Policy Projects

This repository highlights projects I have completed at the intersection of public health, economics, and data analysis. The work spans regulatory policy, health economics, and applied research using both U.S. and international data.

## Independent Projects

### Healthcare Data Analysis (RAND Oregon Study)

Completed a data analysis project using the RAND Oregon health insurance dataset to study the relationship between copayments, coverage plans, and hospital visits.  
- Built logistic and linear regression models in R to assess healthcare utilization and out-of-pocket expenditure.  
- Controlled for demographic confounders such as education level and geographic location.  
- Produced a final report and reproducible code hosted on GitHub.

### PKH Cost-Benefit Analysis (Indonesia)

Evaluated the Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), a conditional cash transfer program in Indonesia targeting the poorest 20 percent of households.  
- Applied cost-effectiveness and budget impact analysis to model program outcomes.  
- Estimated an average return on investment of 8.1 percent over 18 years, with significant long-term human capital benefits.  
- Conducted a SWOT analysis to evaluate program sustainability and policy risks.

### Monetary Policy and Banking in Thailand (1800–1905)

Authored a working paper through Johns Hopkins’ Studies in Applied Economics series on Thailand’s 19th century transition from silver to gold standards and the rise of early banking institutions.  
- Collected and analyzed archival trade and financial data.  
- Produced original estimates of Thai money supply based on import and export records.  
- Examined the influence of foreign banks such as HSBC and Banque de l’Indochine on monetary stability.

## Internships

### FDA Regulatory Economics Internship

Interned with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Office of the Commissioner) to analyze the impact of expedited approval programs and regulatory decision-making.  
- Created data visualizations in R showing time reductions between IND and NDA filings.  
- Built a Python scraper to automate Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) extraction, reducing manual lookup time by 55 percent.  
- Identified historical trends in expedited approval pathways to inform internal analysis.

### Cato Institute Health Policy Internship

Worked as a health policy intern with the Cato Institute. Drafted memos, conducted literature reviews, and completed data analysis projects.  
- Wrote weekly policy memos for senior fellows on HHS issues. Topics included overcoding, HSA investments, market capitalization, and CARES Act reimbursement policies.  
- Researched and called state governments (Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina) to track telehealth legislation related to SANE programs.  
- Conducted a drug data analysis project in Excel comparing active ingredient overlap in human and animal drugs using U.S. FDA data and Australian data from the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).
